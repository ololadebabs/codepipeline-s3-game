## codepipeline-s3-matching-game

**THE GAME**

A simple image-matching game. The user clicks two cards (images of memes) to try to match them. If there's a match, the cards disappear from the board. If there's no match, the cards are flipped back to their blank side so the user can try again.

**PROJECT SUMMARY**

Using AWS to create a Continuous Deployment Pipeline that will automatically deploy whenever changes are made to the code. The code for a game is hosted in Github. An S3 bucket for static website hosting is then created for a continuous deployment pipeline (using AWS Code Pipeline) so that the code can be automatically deployed whenever changes are made.

**RESOURCES USED**  Pipeline(V1-type), S3 Bucket

**SCOPE**  Source -> Build & Test -> Deploy. Our _Build & Test_ phase was ommited because the source code was forked from another repo.  

The code for this image-matching game is hosted in this GitHub repository. I created and configured an S3 bucket. NOTE: By default, the bucket is not enabled to host a static website, I therefore enabled the bucket for static website hosting under properties and specified the home/default page of the website( in this case, index.html).

The bucket is unblocked for public access. Under permission, we have to add a bucket policy to make the content of the bucket accessible to the whole world. By validating the bucket policy with our bucket name. The bucket policy has these 4 keywords or phrases (Allow, asterik*, GetObject, Bucket-Name) which simply means we want to allow everybody(*) to view the specified bucket. See bucket policy below;

Everything is set up with GitHub and code building, we have created s3 and configured it for static website hosting, now itâ€™s time to set up the codepipeline that will orchestrate getting the code from GitHub to the bucket and automatically deploy it. The next step is to create a pipeline using AWS Code Pipeline. This pipeline pulls the code from Github and deploys it to S3 whenever a change is detected in the code. See Code Pipeline below;
